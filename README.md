# 🐶 Smart Dog Gear Recommender

An intelligent web app that recommends the perfect collar, harness, and leash combo for your dog — based on photo and behavioral input. Built with Flask, HTML/CSS, and scroll-animated UI inspired by modern design like Akido Labs.

## 🚀 Overview

Finding the right gear for your dog can be overwhelming. This project makes it simple.

Upload a photo of your dog and input details like breed, size, activity level, and temperament. Our system uses image and behavioral data to recommend the best collar, harness, and leash tailored to your dog's comfort, safety, and your budget.

This is not just a form — it’s a smart recommender that adapts to each unique dog.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User uploads a photo** — to assist with breed/body shape confirmation.
2. **User fills out a short form** — breed, size, activity level, temperament, and budget preferences.
3. **AI-Powered Recommendations** — a simple backend (with plans to grow into full ML pipelines) maps inputs to gear combinations using curated data logic.
4. **Frontend displays results** — clean, scroll-animated sections using Tailwind CSS and AOS for fade/slide-in transitions.
